# Login & Dashboard

In this section of the documentation, we'll guide you through the essential steps on how to log in to your WordPress website. Logging in is the first step to accessing the backend of your site, where you can manage content, customize your site's appearance, and perform various administrative tasks. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Login 

The first step to login is through the default WordPress URL, and the credentials needed for access will be sent to your email. These unique login credentials were created for each user to ensure secure access to their respective administrative spaces. If you encounter any difficulties while using these credentials or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to <a href="https://synergie-media.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact us</a>. We are here to help you with any login-related issues.

Please don't share your password with anyone else! If you need to give someone access to your site, you can create a new user for them with a different set of permissions.

## Dashboard

Upon logging in, you'll be greeted by your dashboard, which serves as the command center for your website, enabling you to manage and refresh its content.

The dashboard is organized into several sections:

1. **Posts**: This section is dedicated to managing all articles related to the news section of your website. Here, you can create, edit, or delete posts that appear in the article section of your site.
2. **Media**: This area allows you to manage your media files.

3. **Pages**: In this section, you have control over the various pages displayed on your website. Pages encompass all the links visible on your site, except for articles and property listings, which have their own dedicated sections for management.

4. **Comments**: Please disregard this section, as we do not utilize comments on our website.

5. **Property Listings**: This is where you can manage all property listings visible on the frontend. You can also control their types and classifications.

6. **Profile**: In this section, you can update your login credentials, including your username and password.

7. **Tools**: While WordPress provides this default section, it is not applicable in our case. As mentioned earlier, we use a different technology for the frontend, and the backend has been streamlined to facilitate only the necessary content updates.

8. **Global**: This section holds great significance, as it allows you to make changes to all recurring elements on the website. Here, you can update general links and repeated sentences throughout the site to maintain consistency and simplify content management.
